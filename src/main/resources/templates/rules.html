            <h2>Checkers Game Rules</h2>
            <p>Checkers is a board game for two players, using a 8x8 board and 12 pieces for each player.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The goal of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot make a move.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Starting Setup</h3>
            <p>Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the black squares of the first three rows on their side of the
                board.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Moves</h3>
            <p>Players take turns. Pieces can only move diagonally one square forward to an empty black square.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Capturing Pieces</h3>
            <p>If an opponent's piece is on a neighboring diagonal square, and there is an empty square behind it, the piece
                can
                jump over the opponent's piece and land on the empty square, removing the opponent's piece from the
                board.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Becoming a King</h3>
            <p>When a piece reaches the last row on the opposite side of the board, it becomes a king. A king can move
                diagonally forward and backward any number of squares.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>End of the Game</h3>
            <p>The game ends when one player captures all the opponent's pieces or blocks them so they cannot make a
                move.
